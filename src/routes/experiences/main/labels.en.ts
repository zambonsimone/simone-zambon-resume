    GSD: `Since July 2021 my job is focused on developing new features, fixing bug and writing tests for the 
    the software factory of Gruppo San Donato, a big private hospitals holding located in Milano (Italy),
    which creates, maintains and improves applications both for their users/customers
    and for internal use of their employees.
    
    The main applications I worked on is the ones addressed to customers which give them various services related to their activity involved
    in the group clinics, like reservation of exams and management of their own medical documents and reports.
    
    Even if bugfixing was a daily task, I could develop several new important features, from side to core features. On every new functionality implementation, the usability of the code and the UI were
    tested by unit and UI tests written by my team.
    <a>Go to the ITSkills page to see in details which technologies I used in this commission</a>
             
    We worked in cooperation with a skilled UX/UI team that designed the application UI to satisfy the highest and most recent standards and also to
    to be fully accessible by people with disabilities.

    Anyway, small design activities could have been up to us
    front end developers, like vector graphic files modifyings that we used to generate icons and fonts. 

    As one of the most expert team member I was also involved in new members onboarding and training.
    The effort of the team to make the code well organized and inspired by the best practices was very high, 
    and every change in the main branches was closely reviewed by other team members.

    This is the most important commission I worked for, it formed me officially as a developer as it is where
    I could cover all the main activities a front end developer is usually involved in, with noteworthy autonomy and decisional power.`,
    SYSKOPLAN_REPLY: `Syskoplan is a branch of Reply, a multinational holding company located in Switzerland and leader in the IT market.
    When I worked with the team of Syskoplan we were committed to maintain and implement new functionalities for a ERP application for "Saipem S.p.A",
    an italian company operating in the areas of energy and infrastructures.  

    It had been the first time that I have worked for an application definitely intended to be focused on functionalities and data manipulation accuracy than 
    on a charming user-friendly graphic and experience.
    The application was built in SAPUI5, a framework usually utilized to build ERP applications. 
    It was composed by several small applications provided by SAP Fiori, which also
    guarantees smart design and workflow: each application provided a different functionality to manage and monitor 
    different activities related to the oil platforms of the company, for example logistic monitoring or human resources managing, 
    and was intended to be used by users with a specific role and permissions.
    Each application shares data with a database which was alike implemented and owned by Syskoplan.

    My main task was to fix bug and implement new application when the customer Saipem asked us a new functionality.
    Javascript was essentially the only programming language I used here, in addition to some basic XML views to design the UI of the applications.
    As mentioned above, the use of custom styles was almost null, also given that the UI provided by SAP Fiori
    is already optimized and responsive for any device and resolution.`,
    UNICREDIT: `UniCredit is an international bank group as well as the biggest in Italy where it counts more than 2.000
    branch offices.
    I worked here in collaboration with a chosen team composed by developers of Dale Consulting and we
    were appointed to solve incidents and bugs in databases of the production environment and to test ETLs, to lead the migration process of All
    UniCredit users grouped by country from a PFM application to another one developed by Meniga, and handle the rollout process.

    As our tasks consisted of handling very important and sensitive data in production databases for such a big company,
    we had to face situations with a strong stress that was not easy to manage.
    The operations must be usually executed during night time and they were assigned suddenly,
    any error led to issues from important ones to very critical ones, and I were also appointed to
    onboard new team members as there was a significant desertion rate due to the stressful conditions mentioned above.

    Here I could practice very much DB queries, written in PL/SQL or T/SQL (depending on the PFM application databases we were operating on)
    with many sort of clauses, also using Microsoft Excel to help us to generate the thousand lines of query code.`
